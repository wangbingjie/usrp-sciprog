It also requires the function we want to minimize to have a certain form - a sum of squares - which is exactly what we have.  Because it makes that assumption, it's less generally useful, but it's better at solving these sorts of problems than a more general optimizer, like [`scipy.optimize.minimize`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize).\n",
